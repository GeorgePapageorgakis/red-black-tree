#### red-black-tree
Red Black Tree implementation based on "Introduction to Algorithms 3rd edition - Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein" (chapter 13)

Purpose: A simple implementation of a Red Black Tree in C, windows edition

A red-black tree is a binary tree that satisfies the following 5 red-black properties:
* Every node is either red or black.
* The root is black.
* Every leaf (NIL) is black.
* If a node is red, then both its children are black.
* For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
